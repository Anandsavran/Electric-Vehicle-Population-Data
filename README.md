🔋 Project Title: Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis
📘 Project Description:
This data science project explores and analyzes the Electric Vehicle (EV) population dataset to uncover insights into the growing adoption of EVs across regions. The dataset includes details such as vehicle types, makes, models, model years, electric range, and more.

The goal of the project is to identify trends, usage patterns, regional adoption rates, and correlations that can guide policymakers, manufacturers, and consumers in making data-driven decisions about electric mobility.

📊 Key Objectives:
🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, standardize formats, and prepare data for analysis.

📈 Trend Analysis: Track the growth of EVs over time, by region, and by vehicle type (Battery Electric, Plug-in Hybrid).

🌍 Geographical Insights: Map the distribution of EVs across cities or states to identify high-adoption zones.

🚗 Vehicle Insights: Analyze which manufacturers and models dominate the EV market.

⚡ Electric Range Analysis: Study the distribution of electric ranges and its correlation with model year or vehicle type.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium

Platform: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Data Source: Public EV population dataset (e.g., from a transportation department or open government data portal)

📌 Sample Insights:
📆 Majority of registered EVs are post-2017 models, showing a sharp adoption rise.

🚙 Tesla leads in EV registrations followed by Nissan and Chevrolet.

🌐 Urban areas show significantly higher EV concentrations compared to rural areas.

🔌 Vehicles with higher electric ranges tend to be more recent and predominantly from premium manufacturers.

🎯 Learning Outcomes:
Mastery of real-world data cleaning and wrangling.

Experience with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization.

Understanding of electric vehicle trends and the EV ecosystem.

Skills in drawing actionable insights from raw data using Python.
